According to the product documentation, Abnormal Security will remove malicious events from Microsoft Outlook calendars
when remediating ICS phishing attacks. As far as we can tell though, Google Calendar events will not be deleted. To
remove malicious Google Calendar events when using Abnormal Security,
use [`abnormal_security-google_workspace.py`](./abnormal_security-google_workspace.py).
